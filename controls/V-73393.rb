  title "The Active Directory Infrastructure object must be configured with
  proper audit settings."
  desc "When inappropriate audit settings are configured for directory service
  database objects, it may be possible for a user or process to update the data
  without generating any tracking data. The impact of missing audit data is
  related to the type of object. A failure to capture audit data for objects used
  by identification, authentication, or authorization functions could degrade or
  eliminate the ability to track changes to access policy for systems or data.

      For Active Directory (AD), there are a number of critical object types in
  the domain naming context of the AD database for which auditing is essential.
  This includes the Infrastructure object. Because changes to these objects can
  significantly impact access controls or the availability of systems, the
  absence of auditing data makes it impossible to identify the source of changes
  that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and
  systems throughout an AD domain. The lack of proper auditing can result in
  insufficient forensic evidence needed to investigate an incident and prosecute
  the intruder.

  Review the auditing configuration for Infrastructure object.

  Open Active Directory Users and Computers (available from various menus or
  run dsa.msc).

  Ensure Advanced Features is selected in the View menu.

  Select the domain being reviewed in the left pane.

  Right-click the Infrastructure object in the right pane and select
  Properties.

  Select the Security tab.

  Select the Advanced button and then the Auditing tab.

  If the audit settings on the Infrastructure object are not at least as
  inclusive as those below, this is a finding.

  Type - Fail
  Principal - Everyone
  Access - Full Control
  Inherited from - None

  The success types listed below are defaults. Where Special is listed in the
  summary screens for Access, detailed Permissions are provided for reference.
  Various Properties selections may also exist by default.

  Type - Success
  Principal - Everyone
  Access - Special
  Inherited from - None
