  title "Windows Server 2016 must automatically remove or disable emergency
  accounts after the crisis is resolved or within 72 hours."
  desc "Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts established
  in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is
  required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
  authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system
  maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting
  system availability.

  Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used
  accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network
  or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts are not
  subject to automatic termination dates. Emergency accounts are accounts created
  in response to crisis situations, usually for use by maintenance personnel. The
  automatic expiration or disabling time period may be extended as needed until
  the crisis is resolved; however, it must not be extended indefinitely. A
  permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term
  maintenance accounts.

  To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated
  with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed
  access control policy requirements.
