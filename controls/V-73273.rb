  title "Systems requiring data at rest protections must employ cryptographic
  mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the
  information at rest."
  desc "This requirement addresses protection of user-generated data as well
  as operating system-specific configuration data. Organizations may choose to
  employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity
  protections, as appropriate, in accordance with the security category and/or
  classification of the information.

  Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the
  integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is
  commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the
  information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all
  information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific
  data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).
