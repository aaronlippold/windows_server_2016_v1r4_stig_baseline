  Current hardware and virtual environments may not support virtualization-based
  security features, including Credential Guard, due to specific supporting
  requirements, including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run
  the Hyper-V feature within a virtual machine.

  Open PowerShell with elevated privileges (run as administrator).

  Enter the following:

  Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_DeviceGuard -Namespace
  root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard

  If SecurityServicesRunning does not include a value of 1 (e.g., {1,
  2}), this is a finding.

  Alternately:

  Run System Information.

  Under System Summary, verify the following:

  If Device Guard Security Services Running does not list Credential
  Guard, this is finding.

  The policy settings referenced in the Fix section will configure the following
  registry value. However due to hardware requirements, the registry value alone
  does not ensure proper function.

  Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  Registry Path: \\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard\\

  Value Name: LsaCfgFlags
  Value Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 0x00000001 (1) (Enabled with UEFI lock), or 0x00000002 (2) (Enabled
  without lock)
