  Review user account mappings to PKI certificates.

  Open Windows PowerShell.

  Enter Get-ADUser -Filter * | FT Name, UserPrincipalName, Enabled.

  Exclude disabled accounts (e.g., DefaultAccount, Guest) and the krbtgt account.

  If the User Principal Name (UPN) is not in the format of an individual's
  identifier for the certificate type and for the appropriate domain suffix, this
  is a finding.

  For standard NIPRNet certificates the individual's identifier is in the format
  of an Electronic Data Interchange - Personnel Identifier (EDI-PI).

  Alt Tokens and other certificates may use a different UPN format than the
  EDI-PI which vary by organization. Verified these with the organization.

  NIPRNet Example:
  Name - User Principal Name
  User1 - 1234567890@mil

  See PKE documentation for other network domain suffixes.

  If the mappings are to certificates issued by a CA authorized by the
  Component's CIO, this is a CAT II finding."
