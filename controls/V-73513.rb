  Current hardware and virtual environments may not support virtualization-based
  security features, including Credential Guard, due to specific supporting
  requirements, including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run
  the Hyper-V feature within a virtual machine.

  Open PowerShell with elevated privileges (run as administrator).

  Enter the following:

  Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_DeviceGuard -Namespace
  root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard

  If RequiredSecurityProperties does not include a value of 2 indicating
  Secure Boot (e.g., {1, 2}), this is a finding.

  If Secure Boot and DMA Protection is configured, 3 will also be
  displayed in the results (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).

  If VirtualizationBasedSecurityStatus is not a value of 2 indicating
  Running, this is a finding.

  Alternately:

  Run System Information.

  Under System Summary, verify the following:

  If Device Guard Virtualization based security does not display Running,
  this is finding.

  If Device Guard Required Security Properties does not display Base
  Virtualization Support, Secure Boot, this is finding.

  If Secure Boot and DMA Protection is configured, DMA Protection will
  also be displayed (e.g., Base Virtualization Support, Secure Boot, DMA
  Protection).

  The policy settings referenced in the Fix section will configure the following
  registry values. However, due to hardware requirements, the registry values
  alone do not ensure proper function.

  Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  Registry Path: \\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard\\

  Value Name: EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity
  Value Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 0x00000001 (1)

  Value Name: RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures
  Value Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 0x00000001 (1) (Secure Boot only) or 0x00000003 (3) (Secure Boot and DMA
  Protection)
