  desc "When directory service data files, especially for directories used for
  identification, authentication, or authorization, reside on the same logical
  partition as user-owned files, the directory service data may be more
  vulnerable to unauthorized access or other availability compromises. Directory
  service and user-owned data files sharing a partition may be configured with
  less restrictive permissions in order to allow access to the user data.

    The directory service may be vulnerable to a denial of service attack when
  user-owned files on a common partition are expanded to an extent preventing the
  directory service from acquiring more space for directory or audit data.
